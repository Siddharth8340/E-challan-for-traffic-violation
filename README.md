# E-challan-for-traffic-violation
The E-Challan Traffic Violation Management System is a web-based application that automates the process of issuing challans (fines) for traffic violations. Instead of manual challan slips, this system maintains digital records that improve transparency, efficiency, and accessibility for both traffic authorities and citizens.
